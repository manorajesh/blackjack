# Blackjack in the Terminal (kinda)!
Play the iconic game right in your terminal (or a separate window if you running on Windows)! This isn't feature complete, but I posed it as a simple test for me to write in Rust.

## Installation
Clone the repo and build
```shell
git clone https://github.com/manorajesh/blackjack.git
cargo run --release
```

## Usage
The controls are very simple:
```
h ~ Hit
s ~ Stand
+ ~ Increase bet
- ~ Decrease bet
q ~ quit
```
